# Journal Entry - 2026-01-11-20-07-46

- What changed, why:
  - Added visibility-aware gating for the typing timer so background tabs stop re-rendering while hidden.
  - Added a unit test to assert the timer interval starts only when the document is visible.
  - Updated CURRENT.md to reflect the active execplan and test status.
- What was observed:
  - `npm run test:unit -- typing-ritual-visibility.test.tsx` failed because Next.js SWC bindings were missing for linux/arm64.
- Commit links:
  - 3298c88 Pause typing timer when tab is hidden
